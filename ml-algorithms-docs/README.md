# Machine Learning Algorithms Documentation

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Documentation project! This repository aims to provide comprehensive documentation for various machine learning algorithms, covering their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create a structured and detailed reference for machine learning practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts. Each algorithm is documented with sections that include an overview, mathematical foundations, optimization techniques, and more.

## Structure

The documentation is organized into the following main directories:

- **docs/**: Contains all the documentation files.
  - **README.md**: Overview of the documentation project.
  - **templates/**: Contains templates for documenting algorithms.
  - **algorithms/**: Individual markdown files for each machine learning algorithm, including:
    - `linear-regression.md`
    - `logistic-regression.md`
    - `decision-trees.md`
    - `random-forest.md`
    - `gradient-boosting.md`
    - `svm.md`
    - `knn.md`
    - `naive-bayes.md`
    - `kmeans.md`
    - `pca.md`
    - `neural-networks.md`
    - `bayesian-methods.md`
  
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with practical examples and experiments for selected algorithms.
  - `linear_regression.ipynb`
  - `random_forest.ipynb`
  - `neural_networks.ipynb`

- **examples/**: Provides example files for Python and R, including dependencies and metadata.
  - **python/**: Contains `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
  - **r/**: Contains `DESCRIPTION` file for R packages.

- **mkdocs.yml**: Configuration file for MkDocs, specifying the structure and navigation of the documentation site.

- **pyproject.toml**: Configuration file for Python projects, detailing dependencies and project metadata.

- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts for the project.
