    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Overview\n",
    "Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Type\n",
    "Linear Regression is primarily used for regression problems where the goal is to predict a continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "The linear regression model can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_n x_n + \\epsilon \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( y \\) is the predicted value.\n",
    "- \\( \\beta_0 \\) is the intercept.\n",
    "- \\( \\beta_i \\) are the coefficients of the predictor variables.\n",
    "- \\( x_i \\) are the predictor variables.\n",
    "- \\( \\epsilon \\) is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Function\n",
    "The cost function for linear regression is the Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ J(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( m \\) is the number of training examples, \\( y_i \\) is the actual value, and \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Techniques\n",
    "Common optimization techniques for linear regression include:\n",
    "- Gradient Descent\n",
    "- Normal Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameters\n",
    "Linear Regression has few hyperparameters, but regularization techniques like Lasso and Ridge introduce parameters such as \\( \\alpha \\) (regularization strength).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "Linear Regression relies on several assumptions:\n",
    "- Linearity: The relationship between the predictors and the target is linear.\n",
    "- Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of errors.\n",
    "- Normality: Errors are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "- Simple to implement and interpret.\n",
    "- Computationally efficient.\n",
    "- Works well with linearly separable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. Data Collection\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "3. Model Training\n",
    "4. Model Evaluation\n",
    "5. Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementations\n",
    "Linear Regression can be implemented using libraries such as:\n",
    "- Scikit-learn\n",
    "- Statsmodels\n",
    "- TensorFlow/Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning can be performed using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best regularization parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "Common evaluation metrics for linear regression include:\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "- Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "- R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bias-Variance Analysis\n",
    "Linear Regression can suffer from bias if the model is too simple (underfitting) and high variance if the model is too complex (overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overfitting Handling\n",
    "Techniques to handle overfitting include:\n",
    "- Regularization (Lasso, Ridge)\n",
    "- Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparisons\n",
    "Linear Regression can be compared with other algorithms like:\n",
    "- Polynomial Regression\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "- Support Vector Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "Linear Regression is widely used in various fields such as:\n",
    "- Economics (predicting sales, prices)\n",
    "- Real Estate (predicting house prices)\n",
    "- Healthcare (predicting patient outcomes)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Projects\n",
    "1. Predicting house prices using a dataset like Boston Housing.\n",
    "2. Analyzing the impact of advertising on sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Optimization\n",
    "Performance can be optimized by:\n",
    "- Feature scaling\n",
    "- Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Interview Questions\n",
    "- What are the assumptions of linear regression?\n",
    "- How do you handle multicollinearity?\n",
    "- Explain the difference between Lasso and Ridge regression."
